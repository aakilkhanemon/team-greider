> This is our main repository for the HackBio'2021 Virtual Internship Experience for #Team-Greider. <br>
Main goal of the project is write small scripts in different languages with the next output in sdout - `name, e-mail, slack_username, biostack, `. Next step is to make csv file with rows corresponding to the person and columns to the values (as name, e-mail, etc) in bash, using sdout from scripts. <br>

## I am not a coder, what should I choose?
Everyone began from something (: Actually the language in this task doesn't matter, as the script is very simple.
You can search smth similar to "write hello world script in *language_of_interest* ".

If all of the languages are checked, and the requirements (about programming language variety) are satisfied, you are free to choose whatever language you like. A good start is to become more familiar with R or Python. Both of these languages are extremely popular within the bioinformatics community. See templates for "Hello world script" for [R](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hello-world-in-r-programming/) and [Python](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Hello,_World!).

## Unified template for output
Human text is an excellent example of unstructured data. Desired fields (for this task) can be printed out in many different ways. Therefore I propose a unified template for your script output:


```bash
NAME: *Your full name*
E-MAIL: *Your e-mail* 
SLACK USERNAME: @+*username*
BIOSTACK: *Name of biostack you chose. The only first letter is capital* 
```
An example:
```bash
NAME: Siddhant Sharma
E-MAIL: siddhaantsharma.ss@gmail.com
SLACK USERNAME: @siddhant
BIOSTACK: Genomics
```
**After you get the desired output, please name your file _stage_0_slack-username_ <br> An example:** 
`stage_0_Siddhant.R`
